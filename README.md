# Neovim

My neovim config. Has all the things I need and none I don't.

Mostly [echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugins + some essentials like [neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).

All plugins are pinned to the specific commits (except for treesitter) to avoid unexpected breaking changes.

The only bloat here is [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) and snippets which is nice but doubles startup time (+50ms).
I've used [mini.completion](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-completion.md) before but it's very basic and does not cover all my needs
