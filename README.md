# Neovim

My neovim config. Has all the things I need and none I don't.

- All plugins are pinned (except for treesitter and theme) to avoid unexpected breaking changes.
- Handy `vim.keymap.set` wrapper that duplicates all mappings for cyrillic layout.
- Smart backspace as seen in JetBrains IDEs ([like this](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/07/the-backspace-key-gets-smarter-in-intellij-idea-14-eap/))
- Mostly [echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) + some essentials (lsp, treesitter)
